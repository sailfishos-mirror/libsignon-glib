  <title>Migrating from libsignon-glib 1.x to libsignon-glib 2.x</title>

  <para>
    The whole API has been reworked to be easily usable with the GObject
    Introspection. It now fully uses the #GTask API internally and provides
    the expected asynchronous functions instead of relying on callbacks.
  </para>
  <para>
    This helps to keep the objects lifecycle sane across the projects. But it
    required some invasive changes in the API.
  </para>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in #SignonAuthService</title>
    <para>
        signon_auth_service_query_mechanisms() has been changed into
        signon_auth_service_get_mechanisms(). There is no more custom callback
        to use, only the #GAsyncResult API. use
        signon_auth_service_get_mechanisms_finish() in your #GAsyncReadyCallback
        to get the mechanisms.
    </para>
    <para>
        In a same manner signon_auth_service_query_methods() has been changed to
        signon_auth_service_get_methods().
    </para>
    <para>
        There are now synchronous methods to get the methods and mechanisms.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Changes in #SignonAuthSession</title>
    <para>
        The long deprecated signon_auth_session_process() has been removed and
        the signon_auth_session_process_async() method has been renamed to
        signon_auth_session_process() as Asynchronous methods are the default
        way to use this API.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Changes in #SignonIdentity</title>
    <para>
        signon_identity_store_credentials_with_args() has been completely
        removed, only signon_identity_store_info() should be used
    </para>
    <para>
        signon_identity_store_credentials_with_info() has been renamed
        to signon_identity_store_info() as #SignonIdentityInfo is the only way
        to get and set the identity informations.
    </para>
    <para>
        signon_identity_add_reference() and signon_identity_remove_reference()
        have been completely removed without replacement.
    </para>
    <para>
        The "id" property is now read-only and only settable at construction
        time. there is a new signon_identity_get_id() method to easily get the
        value of the property. The object now notifies when the property has
        changed with a property signal emition.
    </para>
    <para>
        The "signout" signal has been renamed to #SignonIdentity::signed-out to
        be more descriptive and avoid symbol collisions with the
        signon_identity_sign_out() method.
    </para>
    <para>
        The signon_identity_signout() has been renamed to
        signon_identity_sign_out() to avoid symbol collisions with the "signout"
        signal.
    </para>
    <para>
        All the methods have been modified to use the #GAsyncResult API. use
        *_finish() in your #GAsyncReadyCallback to get the result of the
        operation.
    </para>
